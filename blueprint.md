# Kwon Do-hoo's Learning Coaching Homepage - Revamp Blueprint

## Overview

A professional and persuasive homepage for "권도후의 학습코칭", benchmarked against `https://snucoach.oopy.io`. The site will tell the coach's compelling story to build credibility and trust, clearly present the coaching philosophy, and drive potential customers to apply for a consultation.

## Coach's Core Information
- **Identity:** Catholic University of Korea medical student (2nd year, on leave for coaching).
- **Key Credibility:**
    - High school rank improvement from 313th to 9th.
    - Admitted to Catholic University Medical School via early admission (수시).
    - Also accepted to 2 other universities via comprehensive admission (학종).
    - 4 years of coaching experience.

## Website Structure & Content Strategy
The website will be a single-page narrative that guides the visitor through a logical flow.

1.  **Hero Section:** Strong, trust-building headline (e.g., "313등에서 의대 합격, 그 비결을 코칭합니다").
2.  **Problem Section:** Empathize with student struggles (e.g., "공부는 하는데 성적이 오르지 않나요?").
3.  **Coach's Story Section:** Detail the coach's journey (rank improvement, university admissions) to build proof and credibility. Mention the "성적표" (report card) as a symbol of this journey.
4.  **Coaching Philosophy Section:** Explain the "how" – the unique approach to learning that the coach provides, moving beyond simple tutoring.
5.  **Program Details Section (Placeholder):** Briefly outline what the coaching includes (e.g., "1:1 맞춤 전략", "지속적인 동기부여").
6.  **Call to Action (CTA) / Contact Section:** A clear prompt for users to apply for consultation via the existing modal.

## Technical Plan
- **`index.html`:** Complete restructure to implement the new sections.
- **`style.css`:** A full rewrite of styles to create a clean, modern, and professional aesthetic inspired by the reference site. Will use a card-based layout for clarity and better visual hierarchy. CSS variables for theming (light/dark) will be maintained and expanded.
- **`main.js`:** Verify that the existing modal and dark mode logic function correctly with the new HTML structure. No major new logic is expected, but selectors may need updating.
- **`blueprint.md`:** This file.
- **Git:** All changes will be committed and pushed upon completion.
