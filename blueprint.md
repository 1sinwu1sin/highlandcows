# Kwon Do-hoo's Learning Coaching Homepage - AdSense Quality Upgrade Blueprint

## Primary Goal
To upgrade the website to a "high-quality page" that meets Google AdSense program policies, focusing on user trust, valuable content, and a professional user experience.

## Core Upgrade Strategy
1.  **Build Trust (E-A-T):** Establish Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness by creating essential pages (`About`, `Contact`, `Privacy Policy`) and adding social proof (testimonials).
2.  **Provide Value:** Enhance existing content to be more detailed and original, providing unique insights into the coach's methods.
3.  **Improve UX:** Implement a clear navigation structure and optimize technical aspects like image loading.

## New Site Structure
- **`index.html`:** The main landing page.
- **`about.html`:** A new, detailed page about the coach's story and philosophy.
- **`contact.html`:** A new, dedicated contact page.
- **`privacy.html`:** A new, essential privacy policy page.
- **`style.css`:** The global stylesheet.
- **`main.js`:** The global script file.
- **/images/ (new folder):** To store locally hosted images.

## Action Plan

1.  **Create New Pages:**
    *   **`about.html`:** Expand on the coach's background, motivations, and the "why" behind the coaching.
    *   **`contact.html`:** Provide clear contact methods.
    *   **`privacy.html`:** Generate a standard, comprehensive privacy policy.
2.  **Enhance `index.html`:**
    *   **Navigation:** Add a clear, consistent header navigation bar linking to all new pages.
    *   **Content Expansion:** Deepen the "Philosophy" and create a full "Program Details" section.
    *   **Testimonials:** Add a placeholder section for future social proof.
3.  **Enhance `style.css`:**
    *   Style the new navigation bar.
    *   Download a relevant, license-free image, save it locally in an `/images` folder, and update the hero section background.
    *   Ensure all new pages and sections are styled consistently with the existing design.
4.  **Verify `main.js`:** Ensure scripts for the modal and dark mode continue to function correctly across all pages.
5.  **Git:** Commit and push all changes.
