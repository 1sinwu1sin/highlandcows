            <h2>About Highland Cows</h2>
            <p>Highland cattle (Scottish Gaelic: Bò Ghàidhealach; Scots: Heilan coo) are a Scottish cattle breed. They have long horns and long, wavy, woolly coats that are coloured black, brown, yellow, white, grey, "silver" (white but with a black nose and ears), or tan, and they also may be brindled. Highlands are known as a hardy breed due to their ability to withstand the harsh conditions of the Scottish Highlands.</p>
